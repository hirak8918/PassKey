## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

- All passwords are encrypted locally  
- No plaintext passwords are ever stored  
- App locks automatically when minimized, backgrounded, or closed  
- No biometric authentication (intentional simplicity)  
- If the PIN is forgotten, data is **permanently unrecoverable**  
- Zero data collection — the developer has no access to user data
