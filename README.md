# 🔐 PassKey

**PassKey** is a minimalist, privacy-first, offline-only password manager for Android.  
It securely stores and generates passwords **entirely on your device** — no internet, no cloud sync, no ads, and no tracking.

Built with **Flutter** and designed with simplicity, security, and clarity in mind.

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

- All passwords are encrypted locally  
- No plaintext passwords are ever stored  
- App locks automatically when minimized, backgrounded, or closed  
- No biometric authentication (intentional simplicity)  
- If the PIN is forgotten, data is **permanently unrecoverable**  
- Zero data collection — the developer has no access to user data
